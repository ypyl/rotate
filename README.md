Rotate is a weekly todo application that allows you to create and manage tasks. You can create three types of tasks:

1. Simple Task: A task with a fixed date that needs to be completed by that date.
2. Slice Task: A task that needs to be completed daily and will be moved to the next day if it hasn't been completed on the current day.
3. Cron Task: A task that needs to be completed regularly based on a cron expression.
